Single customers showed the highest subscription rates, indicating potential targeting strategies for the bank.

Customers with higher average yearly balances were more likely to subscribe, highlighting the balance as a key factor in predicting customer engagement.



5. Seasonal Variation in Subscription Rates:

Subscription rates peaked notably in March, September, and December, suggesting an effective timing strategy for campaign intensification.
