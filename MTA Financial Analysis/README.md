## Project Description

This analysis aims to uncover significant insights into the financial operations of the MTA by exploring various aspects of its financial data from 2019 to 2027. The project addresses several key questions that shed light on revenue generation, expense management, and budget adherence across different MTA agencies. The goals of this project are to assess the financial health of the MTA, identify potential areas for financial optimization, and support strategic planning with data-driven insights.

## Data Acquisition

Data was sourced from the State of New Yorkâ€™s Open Data platform using the Socrata Open Data API. This approach allowed for the extraction of comprehensive and up-to-date financial records of the MTA, which include both actual and budgeted figures for revenues and expenses across various fiscal years.

## Analysis Questions

The project sought to answer the following questions:

- Which MTA agencies generate the most revenue?

- How do actual expenses and revenues compare to budgeted values across different agencies?

- What are the major drivers of expenses for the MTA?

- Are there any trends in the financial performance of the MTA over the years covered by the data?

- What impact do reimbursable expenses have on the financial health of the MTA?

- What is the impact of seasonal variations on MTA revenues and expenses?

## Results

### Key findings from this analysis include:

Revenue Distribution Among MTA Agencies: NYCT significantly outperforms all other agencies in revenue generation.

Variance Between Budgeted and Actual Financials: Significant variances were observed, particularly for NYCT, suggesting the need for more accurate budget forecasting.

Key Drivers of Operational Costs: Labor and debt service expenses dominate MTA's expenditures.

Financial Trends Over the Years: There is a steady increase in both revenues and expenses, with a noticeable recovery in net income in later years.

Impact of Reimbursable Expenses: Reimbursable expenses significantly exceed non-reimbursable expenses, highlighting a reliance on reimbursed funding.

Seasonal Impact on Financials: Net income peaks in winter, suggesting higher revenue generation during this season.
